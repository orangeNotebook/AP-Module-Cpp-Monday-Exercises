# AP-Module-Cpp-Monday-Exercises
This repo is part of my 'Advanced Programming' module. It contains all of my Monday tasks / challenges.
## Exercise 1: Quote a quote
Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. However, sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks (both single and/or double quotes) themselves using escape characters (a.k.a.escape sequences).

This C++ program prompts the user for a quote and the nfor an author, it then proceeds to display the quotation and the author in this format:
```
What is the quote? The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Who said it? Walt Disney

Walt Disney says: “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”
```

## Exercise 2: Temperature Conversion
This C++ program converts temperatures from Farenheit, Centigrade and Kelvin. It prompts the user for a temperature and if it's in Farenheit, Centigrade or Kelvin and outputs conversions in the two remaining temperatures.

Example output:
```
Please enter the starting temperature: 60.1
Press 'C' to convert from Centigrade to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
Press ‘F’ to convert from Fahrenheit to Centigrade and Kelvin.
Press 'K' to convert from Kelvin to Centigrade and Fahrenheight

Your choice: F
60.1 degrees Fahrenheit is 15.6111 degrees Centigrade
60.1 degrees Fahrenheit is 288.761 degrees Kelvin
```

## Exercise 3: Area of a Rectangle Room
A C++ program that prompts the user for the length and width of a room, either in feet or meters, then display the area in both feet and meters squared;

Example output:
```
Enter 'F' to use foot
Enter 'M' to use meters

Choice: F
Room length:  15
Room width:  20

Your room's dimension is 15 by 20 foot, the area is:
300 square foot
27.8709 square meters
```
