## Exercise 1: Quote a quote
Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. However, sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks (both single and/or double quotes) themselves using escape characters (a.k.a.escape sequences).

This C++ program promts the user for a quote and the nfor an author, it then proceeds to display the quotation and the author in this format:
```bash
What is the quote? The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Who said it? Walt Disney
Walt Disney says: “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”
```

## Exercise 2: Temperature Conversion
This C++ program converts temperatures from Farenheit, Centigrade and Kelvin. It promts the user for a temperature and if it's in Farenheit, Centigrade or Kelvin and outputs conversions in the two remaining temperatures.

## Exercise 3: Area of a Rectangle Room
A C++ program that prompts the user for the length and width of a room, either in feet or meters, then display the area in both feet and meters squared;

## Number Guesser:
A C++ ‘guess the number’ game that supports three levels of difficulty; level 1 is limited to numbers 1..10, level 2 is limited to numbers 1..100 and level 3 is limited to numbers 1..1000. It prompts the user to select a difficulty level before the game begins. The program picks a random number and prompts the player to ‘guess’; each time the player ‘guesses’ the program provides a hint (e.g., too low, too high).
The program logs the number of guesses and once correct tells the player how many attempts were made before asking them to ‘play again’.
